# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to supply a project to test your code-testing abilities. Included is a small webapp that pulls from an API, and displays results. There's also an e2e testbed (Jasmine) as well as a unit test testbed (Karma). See `README.md` for details on running each.

## Tasks to Complete
There are a handfull of test files (`*.spec.ts`) that are filled with either failing units or prompts to add unit tests. They are marked by both `// TODO:` markers as well as filled with a failing test (`expect(false).toBeTruthy();`). Please see and complete those. 

Additionally, there's an e2e spec file (`app.e2e-spec.ts`) that has empty test clauses for your attention.

Please make it as far as you can, and add additional test cases where you see fit to.

## Delivery on Completion
Please push your completed code repository to a remote repository (GitHub, Bitbucket) and provide us with the url and public access.
